PhD Researcher — Soil Science * Artificial Intelligence * Climate Modelling

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


👋 About Me

Hello! I’m Choukouriyah, a PhD researcher working at the intersection of soil science, machine learning, and climate modeling.
My current research focuses on soil carbon monitoring under future climate scenarios, combining remote sensing, AI models, and environmental data.

I’m currently working with the University of Tübingen, Stellenbosch University and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, where I explore new ways to integrate satellite imagery, vegetation indices, land-use information, and climate projections for better understanding global soil processes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔬 Research Interests

- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
  
- Soil organic carbon estimation

- Climate scenario modeling (future climate impacts)

- Machine learning & deep learning for Earth systems

- Remote sensing (Sentinel, Landsat, GEE)

- Environmental monitoring & data-driven climate resilience

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎓 Current PhD Research

In my first year of PhD, I am developing interdisciplinary approaches for predicting soil carbon under changing climate conditions.

My current exploratory directions include: Using Sentinel spectral bands + vegetation indices - Processing large-scale satellite imagery in Google Earth Engine - Integrating future climate projections with remote-sensing features -Evaluating LULC patterns and biogeophysical variables and Experimenting with ML frameworks for carbon estimation

Although early in the journey, I have already identified key trends in the soil–climate–AI literature that will guide the next stages of my research.
